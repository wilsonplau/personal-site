> “As human beings we are as impermanent as everything else is…When we’re thinking that we’re competent or that we’re hopeless — what are we basing it on? On this fleeting moment? On yesterday’s success or failure? We cling to a fixed idea of who we are and it cripples us. Nothing and no one is fixed.”

– Pema Chödrön in The Places that Scare You

![On Impermanence and Uncertainy](./img/february-5-fb.jpg)

We tend to cling to an identity. Of course, this is a natural compulsion but we should pause when we find ourselves grasping tightly to this idea of who we are. When we tell ourselves and others that this is just what I do, this is just what I like, this is just the way I am with unwavering conviction, we leave ourselves closed to possibility and unnecessarily confrontational about the way things are.

There is impermanence and uncertainty to everything. Thus, we must cultivate an ability to hold all things loosely. We must learn to find comfort in the uncertainty that not only do we not know how others feel and think, how the world works and should work, but also that we might not really know ourselves all that well either. That that ideas we cling onto so tightly can be wound loose once we give ourselves more space to explore, to experiment, and to learn.

It’s a gift to find ourselves surprised about something that we never thought we would enjoy, something that we never thought we would accept, something that we realize afterwards that we never really understood or appreciated — to find a new part of us that we never knew before.

So, let go of that clenched fist for a moment today and just relax in the uncertainty and impermanence of the present. You may be pleasantly surprised with what you find.
