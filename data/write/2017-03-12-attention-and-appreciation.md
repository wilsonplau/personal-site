> We can learn to rejoice in even the smallest blessings our life holds. It is easy to miss our own good fortune; often happiness comes in ways we don’t even notice… The key is to be here, fully connected with the moment, paying attention to the details of ordinary life…This combination of mindfulness and appreciation connects us fully with reality and brings us joy.”

– Pema Chödrön in The Places that Scare You

A photographer finds beauty through framing. No matter how seemingly banal or even ugly we may find something, there is always a perspective through which we can find beauty in it. It is our control over the context and way in which we view something that colors our interpretation of it. There is nothing inherently ugly or unworthy of our appreciation; it is always perspective.

A writer finds beauty by illuminating our mutual human experience. There is always something beautiful to be found in human experience, if only because we share it, because we can empathize, because we recognize that we are all on this journey through life together. That we’re all the same, imperfect people with fundamentally similar toils and strifes is makes life so beautiful.

A child finds beauty in unadulterated curiosity. Everything is because it is new, it is unexpected, it is remarkable and exciting and wonderful. That reality doesn’t change as we grow up; everything we encounter is still new and different and exciting in its own way. We’ve simply allowed ourselves to become less curious, less excited about it.

What we focus our attention on and what we choose to appreciate colors our perspective of the world and our lives. The world is beautiful. Our lives are beautiful. You simply have to let yourself see that.
