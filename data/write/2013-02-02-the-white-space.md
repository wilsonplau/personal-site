I’m suffering from excess white space — that is, I’ve let myself open up so many Pandora’s boxes of unknown yet wildly interesting ideas, all of which I’ve convinced myself could make a difference in how I see business today.

I am reminded of a certain John’s philosophy about being passionate about something: have you read all of the books significant to the field? Do you know of this person or that person’s work? And I must admit that I cannot proudly answer that I have. I write this intending to reflect on what direction I’d like to go in for the next little while of my life.

I expect this list to be victim to many, many edits.

1. Business + Anthropology/Ethnography: I’ve been intrigued by this combination ever since being exposed to the work that ReD Associates does — this whole concept of using the more robust social science of anthropology/ethnography to one, understand consumers and two (more interestingly), understand the core competencies of a business. Moreover, Mintzberg’s “Managing” has very wisely hit on how we study management — we tend to look at short vignettes of decisions rather than, say, as if we were writing an ethnography. I believe that we have yet to study business as a social function to the depth that anthropology and ethnography have to offer.

2. Interaction Design: I don’t mean interaction design in terms of software/interface design. I’m interested in the more abstracted form of interaction design — this whole idea of designing for ‘affordances’, BJ Fogg’s work on ‘behaviour design’ and a less established field of interaction design in social contexts. I am intrigued by the idea of using interaction design as a tool for management control — we are still currently taught the severely flawed model of revenue/profit centers and incentivization. Can we instead use some new model of design to nudge people to do what we would like them to do instead?

3. Social Network and Complexity Theory: There is a frustration in trying to understand people; however, place a person in the middle of a social network and our ability to understand them becomes exponentially more difficult. I’m curious about the science of this, and I’m intrigued about how young the science is and how much more there is left to uncover. I’ve recently picked up Nicholas Christakis’ and Geoffrey West’s work and I wish I could start to understand what the Santa Fe Institute is doing. Corporations, stripped of its hard assets and legal frameworks, are little more than social networks. We must understand them from a social network perspective if we are to say that we understand corporations at all.

4. Workplace Environment Design: Steelcase and Herman Miller have pioneered this field with their respective research and consulting practices that seem to serve primarily as a complement to their obvious primary business of furniture. I get a sense that this may be a stronger foundation for what I casually call ‘interaction design’ and I’m curious about how these companies approach the design of workplaces. I also often wonder what those who work in these practices believe about their influence in the operations of the organization they’re working with. My hypothesis is that this influence is likely underestimated by both furniture companies and their clients.

5. Peter Drucker: I often chide others for not even knowing the name Peter Drucker, but I must admit that I have yet to sit down and study Drucker as I probably should. I distinctly remember reading Drucker’s “Management as a Social Function and Liberal Art” and being extremely moved at the realization of how human businesses were. I liken it to the moment when you realize the big scary monster is just about playful, emotional animal at heart — and that moment changed how I see businesses. I wonder how many more gems are left in his repertoire for me to uncover. I often joke that I plan on going to a Japanese temple for a month or two to study zen buddhism, meditation and Peter Drucker. I wish I was a bit more serious about that, or at least do the Drucker part without the Japan part.

I was reluctant to write this because of this fear that I was forget something and that my neglect would be symptomatic of how I don’t care about the subject. So let’s just keep this forever incomplete.
