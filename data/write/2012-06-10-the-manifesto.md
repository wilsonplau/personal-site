If you knew me better, you’d know that I love a good manifesto. In the last few weeks, I’ve gotten the opportunity to attempt to explain in some level of brevity the thinking that I’ve been doing around interaction design and its place in business. This is my attempt at channeling that clarity of thought into one document.

I’d like to preface this discussion with the mindset with which I approach this line of thinking. Currently, what I look to investigate is not an opinion about how businesses should operate, but instead it’s how we should be thinking about businesses altogether. Eventually, it may extend to conclusions about how businesses should operate — however, I can only look forward to more specific discussions with more knowledgeable business thinkers and designers to lead me towards those conclusions.

The question that this manifesto hopes to answer is one that I’ve been pondering for the longest time — how do we bring design and business together? The answer that has become more and more popularized, from what I’ve seen, is on two levels: one, using industrial/service design to create better products and services, and two, using systems design to develop better business models and value-creating activities. I deeply admire all the work that has been done in those areas, and I always long to learn more about the thinking in those processes, but I’d like to offer a different take on how we should be looking at business from a design point-of-view.

It’s a point of view that is deeply rooted in the theories behind urban and interaction design, and from my interpretation, witnessed in the intuitive steps that some companies have taken in recent years.

To begin, we must first understand that a company is made up of no more than a series of interactions between people. And these interactions happen at different scales that is — we can think of companies as interactions between employees on a very micro level, but also as interactions between teams and divisions, between companies and industries, even. And what an interaction can hope to do then, given this perspective, is to create rules, structures and processes that create affordances for what kind of behaviour the company wants to promote. We design entire corporations — from training to workplace to culture — to afford the behaviour that strategy dictates. Just like the quintessential doorknob example, this allows us instill behaviour in employees, not by telling them what to do, but by designing everything around them so that they behave in the way that is most ideal for a firm.

And I believe that this line of thinking extends in two directions -

\*_One_/ — if we begin to think in this way, we must realize that we have to radically simplify corporations and look at the in a more modular form. Chris Zook of Bain, in his book Repeatability, praises the simplicity of a company that only products 60 products — Apple. The rest of the companies within its value network — app developers, media companies, Foxconn, etc — are all designed to interact with it in a certain way. This therefore leads us to much more meaningful thinking into how one company or division should be interacting with one another to truly create the synergies and value that they bring to each other. The concepts of M&A and supplier/distributor/retailer relationships therefore adopt a different level of importance — to the extend that we must start thinking about how we must design systems around them to encourage the company-to-company interactions that we want.

**Two** — if we think in this way, we have to begin to contemplate the effects of interactions that we never think of. I mentioned in The Evolutionary Corporation that business theory forces us to thinking in terms of competitive reactions, Porter’s Five Forces and Value Chain principles, but we may have excluded an entire realm of interactions that influence companies as well. I reference The Agglomeration Effect as an example, but I believe there is much to uncover.

In short, this is a manifesto that offers and glimpse into the richness of thought that crossing interaction design with business brings. It’s a manifesto that challenges companies to radically simplify themselves so that we may be able to take advantage of the valuable insights that injecting the complexity that interaction design brings. And I truly, truly believe that a well-designed company that places the interaction of one human being with another as the core building block for strategy will create much more elegantly simple, but functionally superior companies that people will love to work for.
