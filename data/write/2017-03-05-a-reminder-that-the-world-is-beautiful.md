> “I cannot pretend I am without fear. But my predominant feeling is one of gratitude. I have loved and been loved; I have been given much and I have given something in return; I have read and traveled and thought and written. I have had an intercourse with the world, the special intercourse of writers and readers. Above all, I have been a sentient being, a thinking animal, on this beautiful planet, and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure.”

– Oliver Sacks in Gratitude

I think we need to remind ourselves that the world is beautiful more often. That even the simple fact that we’re here, that we’re able to experience this moment right now is worthy of our deepest gratitude. It’s unfortunate that I find myself only feeling that gratitude when gifted this reminder by someone like Oliver Sacks.

To appreciate that the world is beautiful requires us to pull ourselves out of the banality of our everyday lives. When we’re distracted. When our days are so consistent and pattern-like. When our attention is focused on getting through the day rather than contemplating beauty in our lives.

So how might we remind ourselves of this more consistently? I think we have to take advantage of the moments that arise when we find something banal in our lives that is beautiful. The color of the sky. A wonderful meal. A smiling face.

And as we encounter these beautiful things in our lives — let them be your reminder, pause, and briefly allow that small kernel of appreciation to blossom into a larger feeling of gratitude that we are here in this moment on this beautiful planet. And what a remarkable thing that is.

Then we can return to our days with a bit more perspective.
