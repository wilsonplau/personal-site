I’ve known about Geoffrey West’s work since this past summer when I came across this article on Edge.org. Since then, I’ve gotten a bit obsessed about cities and have investigated further into the likes of Jane Jacobs, Richard Florida and Edward Glaeser. Their work led to idle musings about workplace design and contemplating about what city I’d like to eventually move to — but I realize that I’ve been asking the wrong question.

Geoffrey West and his colleagues have done a fascinating study on the science of cities — using predictive models for biological metabolism and growth, and applying it to cities and companies. He comes to the conclusion that cities gain increasing returns to scale in metrics of productivity and wages (but also crime rates and pollution; it’s a trade-off), but that companies suffer from diseconomies. As companies grow larger, they suffer from declining ability to innovate and be agile, and inevitably die.

Rather than being satisfied with this conclusion, I think we need to look in a more positive direction. Instead of looking at these results as irrefutable scientific evidence, we have to ask ourselves how we might be able to design corporations so that they can gain the increasing returns, evolve and improve as cities do?

I think the key is in networks. About designing the right set of loops within a company that create economies of scale when it comes to things like production efficiencies and costs, but create increasing returns to scale for aspects like innovation and productivity.

It’s easier said than done, but by looking more closely at biology and more closely at cities, we’ll be able to learn a lot more about how corporations should be defined and run.
