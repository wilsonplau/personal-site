Synthesis posts begin with the raw materials. I present to you this case from ReD Associates on using ethnographic tools to study core competence, and this article from Paul Hartley on ‘Anthrofutures.’

I became intrigued with the use of anthropology in a business context ever since I discovered that what we learn at design school is essentially a not-so-technical and not-so-robust version of the ethnographic methods used in anthropological research. [The Atlantic describes](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/03/anthropology-inc/309218/) it quite well, but basically, the most common application of anthropology in business in in trying to understand customers on a much deeper level.We try to derive the threads of meaning, perception, context, interpretation, experience and emotion to create a more holistic understanding of a product, service or brand.

But that was a bit obvious. (By no means does this imply that it’s not enormously valuable, though.)

What intrigued me most was this single case that ReD Associates worked on: Coloplast. In this engagement they worked on, they worked with the premise that ethnographic methods could be applied internally to a company to understand its culture and core competencies. And more importantly, this richer understanding of culture and core competencies could - and perhaps should - advise the firm’s growth strategy in a more meaningful way than usual. That is - we should not depend entirely upon analyses of market opportunity, NPV and risk factors, but instead, we should look to this ethnographic understanding of the firm’s identity to drive our decision making.

Here’s where the synthesis comes in. While ReD focused mainly on ‘culture’ and ‘core competencies’ in this study, they present this discussion that there may be further opportunity in exploring how organizational competencies are created and destroyed. If use the ‘Anthrofutures’ lens to look at this, we can see that there may exist ‘behavioural, historical, and epistemological currents’ that we can identify for the past and the present that ultimately produce what was and what is a company’s culture and core competence.

Paul Hartley proposes that, if we understand these currents, then we can begin to speculate where the currents will push towards the future to create new technologies and products. If we can understand this much more abstract notion of culture and competencies through a similar lens, then perhaps we can pursue a similar speculation of where the ‘currents’ of a company are leading it, or maybe even design strategy so that we can push these currents in another direction altogether to create a more ideal future for the company.

But first we have to understand all of this better.

What are the appropriate methodologies for approaching the study of a company using ethnography? On what dimensions should we identify these ‘currents’ that form a company’s culture and competencies? In what direction should we extend these currents towards the future? In what way can be begin to introduce interactions that shape the direction of these currents?

Is this what strategic foresight should look like?
