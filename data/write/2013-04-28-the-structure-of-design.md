We tend to talk about design in the form of concepts, analogies and stories. And when we find ourselves unable to express design through words, we start drawing, prototyping and role-playing.

Good design is often expressed this way, because it allows us to understand design through empathy. We can relate to the experience, and therefore, we begin to understand it on an intuitive level.

But being me, I wonder if there’s a more structured way of looking at design, and what benefits flow from it.

A design is comprised of two simple things: an ‘essence’ and a set of design decisions. Jan Chipchase describes essence as the bare essentials of a design; take away anything, and the design can no longer provide the functionality it was designed to provide. The set of design decisions augments the essence and adds features and attributes that enhance the design. Each design decision is meant to positively affect a user’s experience in some way; but the decisions also act as trade-offs - why do we choose to design it in this way, rather than any other way?

From this, we can begin to think about design as a foundation - the essence - and layers of design decisions and the purposes they achieve. Of course, there is a complexity that follows - design decisions often work in tandem to create effects that wouldn’t have existed if made alone. Then perhaps instead of a layers, it’s a network.

Let me give you an example - a plastic fork versus a metal fork. In essence, both fundamentally serve the same purpose - it’s an eating utensil that you can stab things with. But the design decisions are very different - the shape, the material, the packaging, the weight, the color, the pricepoint, the distribution, etc. The material, weight and pricepoint of a plastic fork are all intertwined as a network serve the purpose of making it disposable.

There are benefits that come with this kind of structured thinking in design. We will use the same example to illustrate this.

**1. Extraneous design.** If we cannot explain, with a good, human-centric reason, why we have made a certain design decision, it is almost certainly an unnecessary addition. We often suffer from this when it comes to aesthetics.This structured thinking helps us be simplistic and minimal. Does a plastic fork need to be adorned with gold flake?

**2. Comparable design.** If two designs share the same essence - that is, they serve the same purpose - then we can systematically identify the differences between how two design decisions differ in pursuit of the same purpose, and what different purposes the design decisions serve. This allows us to compare and improve our designs. To serve the same purpose of stabbing food, why does the metal fork have 4 prongs, and the plastic fork have 5?

**3. Trade-offs in design.** We often get to the point where we make economic or resource-constrained decisions around designs, and structure helps us evaluate this. It may be obvious that making our plastic forks rainbow-colored is a high-cost, low benefit trade-off, but it’s often not so easy to identify and decide what to prioritize and what to abandon in a design.

But, as you can expect, it is difficult to inject structure into design.

The fear is, the structure of design often becomes very complicated and unwieldly. A lot of design is tacit and difficult to articulate. While a structured look at design helps us think about design from a more systematic and analytical point of view, we probably still need stories and prototypes to make them meaningful.

So, can we ever get the point where we truly create a comprehensive list of design decisions? Probably not. But is it still helpful to think in a structured way? Yes.
