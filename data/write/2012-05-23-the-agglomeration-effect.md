I mentioned in my last post that there are interactions beyond competitive forces that affect the operations of a business.

Let me give you an example. There’s this effect that exists between companies that’s called the ‘agglomeration effect’ that Richard Florida talks about in his book, ‘Who’s Your City?’ Essentially, it’s a phenomenon from urban studies that has found that firms can benefit from one another by being located close to each other. Think about restaurant clusters. Financial districts. Silicon valley. The proximity of firms facilitates interactions (whether it be firm-to-firm, firm-to-customer, firm-to-customer-to-firm, etc.) that enables companies to be more innovative and productive perhaps through harsher competitive forces, shared resources (suppliers/customers/knowledge), or whatever else might explain this phenomenon.

More significantly, this whole concept leads me down two paths of thought.

One — this variant (perhaps) of the agglomeration effect that I’ve described above takes advantage of shared expertise. Both companies have to specialize in one industry, and so I equate it to the magic of putting two brilliant scientists in a room. (Of course there’s something cool that comes out of that.) But recently, we’ve found that creativity and productiveness may come from the outsider rather than the expert. (Go read Jonah Lehrer’s Imagine.) And my personal experience at design school (and I’m sure both the Ideos and McKinseys of the world would agree), teams benefit from the forced interaction of an eclectic mix of expertise. So then what happens when we stick a bank, a mining company and an fashion startup into a room? How might this other side of the agglomeration work? (Steelcase, the parent company of Ideo, has already started working with footwear company, Wolverine and food company, Meijer, in a co-working space Michigan — we’ll see how that works out.)

And two — to pull us back to this whole larger concept of looking at interactions between firms that are beyond the context of competition, the question I pose to myself and two you is…where else should we look? What many other phenomena beyond this agglomeration effect can we use to design not only better companies, but better industries and better economies? I think there’s a lot more to out there in the worlds of design, sociology, biology, etc.
