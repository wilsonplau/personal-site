When we catch ourselves in moments of negativity, how should we respond?

If you read enough about mindfulness, it sometimes sounds like we’re supposed to be able to close our eyes, take three long breaths, and let go our raging emotions like a soft, fluffy clouds floating away in the sky.

I admit — no, I *recognize and fully embrace* — that I do not have this capability; I am not the Dalai Lama. When I’m mad and sad and frustrated and going crazy from all of those things combined, I am not some manifestation of grace and ease. No — I’m in my bed in a fetal position trying to crawl my way out of it, wanting to fall asleep so I don’t have to deal with reality, or letting the hours pass away with inordinate amounts of bad television.

Yes, mindfulness meditation trains us in the ability to let go: to observe the emotions and thoughts that arise at those moments of negativity, not latch on to them, and let them fade away from our consciousness as we bring our focus back to the present. But, being me, I found that be unsatisfying and somewhat inadequate. I felt like I could _maybe_ let go a bit easier if I could just understand _why_ I was feeling that way, thinking those thoughts, and telling those stories to myself.

I found Brené Brown’s work on shame to offer a breathtaking answer to those questions.

The simple answer is that the anger, the frustration, the disengagement, the paranoid, the fear, the negative thoughts and judgement, the elaborate stories we concoct in our heads can all be often attributed to shame.

We feel shame when our most fundamental human needs feel threatened: our need to be loved and accepted, and by extension, our competence, our strength, our perfect external image, etc.

I find it helpful now to find this shame in myself in those negative moments. What vulnerable spot feels like it’s being attacked? What story am I telling myself that’s making me feel this way? What is the reality?

I’ve learned to repeat this statement, both to myself and others: **whatever story you’re telling yourself (to make yourself feel that way) is not reality.**

I found the same illusory thought patterns repeating on myself:

**1) We attribute maliciousness or negativity, where the culprit is context and incomplete information.** This is perhaps an extension of Hanlon’s Razor: _“Never attribute malice that which is adequately explained by carelessness (or, the less kind version, stupidity or incompetence).”_

Because we are only human, we have a tendency to be self-centric in our interpretations of others’ actions and words. We think that they’re meant to hurt us, intentionally or unintentionally. In reality, the comment or action is often neutral; it is not opinionated, not intended to harm.

In _Rising Strong_, Brené Brown talks about her experience of embracing the assumption that everyone is doing the best they can at any given time. It’s a bit hard to embrace as true, but understand this: people are trying their hardest to react or make decisions within whatever context is available to them. They don’t know what is in our heads, they don’t know what all the past experiences we’ve been through, they don’t know what things might mean to us. They may also be afflicted by their own context, because you don’t know what going through their heads, and what they’ve been through.

Recognize that negativity can often be fully attributed to a difference in context and information.

**2) We also extrapolate untrue implications and make incorrect assumptions about what we observe.** We tell ourselves that because someone said something or did something, it means something. It means that they think differently of us, it means that they don’t like us, it means that they’re X or Y.

Repeat after me: No, it does not; it simply is what it is.

The easiest way to break this cycle of thinking is just to ask, even if it’s a bit awkward. In my own experience, at least 80% of the time, my assumption is not true, and 100% of the time, it is not the full reality of the situation. Once we cultivate this recognition, all of the assumptions in our to show up as they are: assumptions.

**3) Not only do we incorrectly make these extrapolations, we incorrectly interpret them to have implications on our identities.**

Reality is simple and unopinionated. Reality doesn’t provide commentary or judge you on who you are. Reality is just what it is. You don’t need to provide the story arc for yourselves that imbues reality with that force that makes you miserable and ashamed.

**4) And when there is malice, when people speak or act with the intention to shame us, we are more often than not dealing with someone with their own shame.**

This is difficult, because depending on who it is, we may not have the level of trust needed to really get at that shame. Often, we just have to leave it there and find empathy in that we all struggle with this in different ways.

When I look at the world and the interactions between people from this lens, it makes me immensely sad. Shame is pervasive, and we need to develop our awareness and mindfulness of it.

Please read Brené Brown’s work. It might change your life.
