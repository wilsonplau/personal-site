I’ve been toying around with the concept of _epic contexts_ recently. As a society, we’ve reverted to the mundane. I oversimplify, but we live our lives either enshrouded in this religious big picture or adopt a more egocentric context with some aim of personal and family-based happiness. Not to say that’s a bad thing, but I wonder whether or not there is some value in wrapping ourselves in a more _epic_ context. That each and every one of our lives and our actions have some _cosmic significance_ (as Jason Silva puts it). That we can make impacts that can have _evolutionary_ significance? That we were all part of a much more epic story to be told?

I remember the days when I was interviewing for your typical consulting firms. “Why consulting?” was, of course, one of the hallmark questions I had mused about and prepared to some irrational degree. Strange as I was, I had always felt the need to place management consulting into context for my interviewer — as if I were expecting them to hear my response and realize the full vision of their fairly mundane day-to-day work. To me, consulting was epic — in a mere half-century, management consulting had shaped the effectiveness and competitiveness of organizations, thereby giving life to the corporate-run world we live in today.

I don’t believe I converted anyone into thinking that they were working for such a cause. One particular consultant quite memorably reacted with a degrading hint of ridicule even. I still struggle to understand whether or not it was interpreted as a blatant over-the-top exaggeration on my part or it was because people don’t care. Perhaps advising senior executives at the world’s largest organizations is enough.

In my explorations today, I think I look at an even grander context. I remember reading Peter Drucker’s essays, that explained how, in less than 150 years, management has transformed the fabric of social and economic life. In context of societal evolution, we have moved from several millenia of learning to create civilizations and society, to the very, very young stages of forming these units of organization called ‘corporations’ that leverage social networks with an effectiveness and agility we’ve never really seen before. (Even compared to religious organizations and military) To believe that the lean, six-sigma, etc. organizations are anywhere near their prime (whatever that means) is ludicrous.

In understanding how organizations function and how people function within the context of an organization, to me, is not a question of how profitable, competitive or even how ‘innovative’ a company is. It’s a question that has evolutionary significance. We’re continuously contributing to the evolutionary iteration of the social systems we call ‘corporations.’ If a measly sprout of an idea that is the corporation today can shape so much of what we’ve seen in the last century, I wonder how much more a more evolved version of the corporation can impact us tomorrow. That’s the epic context I’d like to enshroud myself in.

I write what I have written above to question myself whether or not its a meaningful endeavour to pursue. And I can hardly say that I’m more motivated than the average person, despite these threads of epic significance running through my head. But it’s an idea that I’d like to play with — to imagine these amazing social systems of the future.

We’ve heard enough about the importance of _purpose_ in companies. Yes, we need purpose — but I don’t think that _what purpose_ is the right question to be asking. But I think the question now is about _context_.

How might we design a epic context for people to work within? And to what extent does that help people become more satisfied and happy in the work and in their lives?
