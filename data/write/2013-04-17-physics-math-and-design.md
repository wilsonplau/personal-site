I recently picked up ‘The Physics of Wall Street’ by James Owen Weatherall. It’s a great read, if you’re even a bit interested in how finance works today, and have a bit of a nerdy appreciation for statistics and math like I do. The book describes, essentially, how finance has evolved as part of a mathematical and scientific discipline. Despite the demonization of the black-box algorithmic trading and hedge funds that this discipline has enabled, I believe there are two things in particular that emerge from what we’ve accomplished in the space of math + physics + finance that are quite beautiful.

I think the first is the realization that math is and continues to be a very natural and human discipline, and therefore is something that designers should embrace and not resent. You can see a glimpse of how beautiful math is as a descriptor of human behaviour in finance — how normal, cauchy and other distributions continue to represent behaviour, how Zipf’s Law and the Pareto Principle hold in numerous social applications. We, as designers, strive to understand how humans act and behave — shouldn’t we somehow appreciate that sometimes, we can represent that as a series of equations?

I say this because we’ve only scratched the surface. Markets allow for an extremely data-fied representation of massive numbers of human decisions — that is, to buy or sell. It is only because this data is available that we begin to see these mathematical patterns emerge in finance. With increased dataficiation — and of course ‘big data’ comes into play here — we may begin to find opportunities to see more behavioural patterns in all kinds of decisions and activities, that can be largely summarized in a mathematical model of some kind. In this way, math should play a role in how designers begin to understand human behaviour in the future.

What’s even more exciting is this second idea. As people create these models of financial behaviour, the market reacts, begins to correct itself and the behaviour basically disappears. Markets become ‘more efficient’, as per Fama’s efficient market hypothesis, and as we continue to develop more models, we see iteration in financial behaviour.

This is remarkable. What would happen if we begin to apply this to other facets of human behaviour? As we start to discover some of the underlying patterns, would we see them adapt or disappear as well? And if we can do this, then do we begin to design human behaviour in a completely different way now? Is this possible? Is this a good thing? Is this even design?
