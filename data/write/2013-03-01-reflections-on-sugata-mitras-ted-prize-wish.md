I cried a bit yesterday morning when after I watched this video. I’m not sure why, precisely, because there was a beautiful rush of thoughts that came to my head by the time he had finished talking. I’m writing this morning to revisit those ideas with a more reflective mind. Please forgive my stream of consciousness.

One of the things that struck me was his approach in framing the educational problem — the educational system is not broken, it is simply designed for a different purpose. And I began to wonder how universal that truth was. That we are not looking at broken systems, but simply fail to realize that it was designed for a completely different purpose to begin with.

When we design something for one purpose, and that purpose shifts, it is more often than not that we attempt to make incremental changes that essentially bandaid the original design. These tweaks mutate the solution like cancer, such that we no longer clearly see the original purpose nor the new purpose in the solution. Rather, it’s a mess of assumptions that may no longer be true or relevant. I feel like I’ve stumbled across a fundamental question that I’ve never really been taught to think about. How do we know when we need to start from the ground up with a new purpose and new parameters, and how do we know when the incremental, iterative improvements are enough? I don’t know.

And of course, this stream of thought brought me back to the fundamentals of corporations again, but more interestingly, the concept of investment as well. Why did we design corporations in the first place, and to what extent are those still valid parameters today? — I now know to see B.Corporations and the concept of triple bottom line as this incremental mutation of corporations, rather than a truly meaningful redesign. And I believe, very closely related to all of this has to be the concept of investment. My intuition tells me that the nature of debt investment is valid — we make some returns — but I don’t understand why the nature of equity investment is to also make returns in almost the same sense. Do we buy into a company so that we can make money? I don’t know, but I can’t wait to hear the financiers of today revolt against whatever theory comes to my mind one day.

The second gut reaction that came to me when watching Mitra’s talk was what would happen if we stuck the modern college kid into a similar educational scenario. Perhaps they would be assigned to small groups and told to educate themselves until they could develop a thesis that constitute some new idea to the world in their field of interest. How would that work?

And I wonder whether or not it’s about good design again. Whether internal motivation is something that we can design. That we can replicate the conditions or philosophy or mindset of young children in India who are devoid of the opportunity to be educated at some of the best educational institutions in the world? Or do Mitra’s samples similarly represent the few among the many who are just that motivated, just as we would probably find everywhere else in the world as well? And what is it that drives us (myself so guiltily included) to use the Internet for Tumblr, cats and Facebook instead of something more enriching? And how long will it take for the Indian kids to start using Snapchat as well?
