> “It’s not about later, when you get it all together and you’re this person you really respect…With all the messy stuff, no matter how messy it is, just start where you are — not tomorrow, not later, not yesterday when you were feeling better — but now. Start now, just as you are.”

– Pema Chödrön in Start Where You Are

Wherever we go, there we are. We are always starting from that point. And the only way to move from there is to start and take that next step towards somewhere else. Nothing changes if we don’t start.

I think we often rely on the world to get us started. We’re waiting for something that’s outside of our control to happen, because we think we need that push to get us moving. We’re waiting for someone to come along and help us. We’re waiting for ourselves to change.

The more we believe this — that the starting pistol is in someone else’s hands — the less control we will feel we have over our lives. The more we will blame the world when things don’t happen in the way that we hope. The more we lose the mindfulness to realize that our thoughts, our emotions, our context doesn’t control us; we do.

But sometimes it just feels very far. And to start is hard when you’re pushing back against a wall of inertia. All we can do is recognize that everything we do in our lives is just a series of tiny little steps, and even the smallest step helps us move forward. The more we cultivate that ability to start, to just get moving, to try something new, the more momentum we can build for our lives and the further we’ll go.

So start by taking that one step. Then start again.
