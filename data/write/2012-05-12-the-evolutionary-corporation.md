I find that we tend to look at companies with a set of limited and prescribed perspectives. It’s all well-taught in business schools — to analyze how a company operates internally, look at how industry forces influence these operations, and to consider how competitors may react given their capabilities. It’s altogether a very aggressive and militaristic view of how companies operate in their environment.

I’d like to contend that we must stop looking at interactions between companies and their competitors in such a militaristic sense, and adopt a more evolution-driven point of view. In short, we have to understand that interaction between competitors is not war-like as much as it is a continuous adaptiveness for evolutionary dominance.

In this context, the initiatives that corporations choose to undertake are not reactionary or confrontative; actions driven by evolution are instead adaptive and constantly focused on a long-term sustained advantage that is dependent more on the inherent conditions of the industry than the ‘predators’ or competitors that the corporation faces temporarily.

Moreover, an evolutionary view of the corporation enables thinking about industry players and adjacent players that isn’t necessarily confrontative. In the same way that organisms can benefit from symbiotic relationships, corporations should look more to their industry partners and competitors as potential interactions that could be mutually beneficial, regardless of the competitiveness between the two parties.

I’d like to explore this more in the next few posts.
