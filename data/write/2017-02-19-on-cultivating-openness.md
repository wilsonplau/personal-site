> “The only reason we don’t open our hearts and minds to other people is that they trigger confusion in us that we don’t feel brave enough or sane enough to deal with. To the degree that we look clearly and compassionately at ourselves, we feel confident and fearless about looking into someone else’s eyes.”

– Pema Chödrön in When Things Fall Apart

We live in a very polarized world these days. As much as we try to be open and accepting of others, it’s difficult to gather the mindfulness to refrain from judgement and dismissal when faced with extremes. _So how might we cultivate a bit more openness?_

We cultivate openness when we clearly see the reality of what we know and believe. That it’s just one perspective informed by our experience, and carries no absolutes and certainties. That there is always a difference between our interpretation of reality and reality. That we simply don’t know everything, and our opinions and beliefs are susceptible to change.

We also cultivate openness when we allow ourselves to entertain an opposing thought in our minds. To pause, let it hang there for a moment, and recognize that there is some context outside of our own in which it might make sense. We must also accept what others say as reality — that what they say is our best window into their experience and what they believe, and what allows us to understand and empathize.

Openness is the act of letting the little cracks of uncertainty through, becoming aware and comfortable with all that don’t know or understand, and responding with our curiosity, attention and empathy.

It’s only with this openness that we can learn and grow together.
