## It often feels like a series of random walks.

You meet up once or twice a week, and set out towards somewhere — further along — in the process. You have a sense of what “further along” is — it’s identifying the key insight your design will be inspired by, it’s the idea that you want to start playing with, it’s the concept for your presentation — but you can never really imagine what the end result looks like, and you don’t really have a preset path to get there. It’s as if you pointed in a general direction somewhere in a foreign city and told yourself that you wanted to get there: a random walk.

The uncertainty can be a bit intimidating, and the business-side of me often wants to pull out my MECE, decision-tree thinking to structure it all away. Or even worse (and admittedly a bit conceited), I come up with elaborate scenarios in my head, where I am somehow able to facilitate this explosively creative process in the group, and end up at a perfect solution I had intended all along. Much like the pretend conversations that I like to think we all make up in our heads, they never go the way we initially imagined.

I’ve realized that it’s a talent to relinquish certainty and structure for randomness and serendipity. Daved Barry once mentioned that the most seasoned of design directors are ‘good’ at design, not because of some inherent creativity (although I’m sure that counts for something), but because of they are able to comfortably hold onto the complete mess that the design process entails, work with long periods of uncertainty, and somehow take advantage of that chaos the create something palpable and well-designed. I’d like to think that I’ve taken my first few baby steps towards that.

The more you experience these random walks, the less ominous they feel. The frustration that follows the inability to predict and control outcomes is overwhelmed by this excitement and amazement to see brilliant and unexpected thinking come from everyone involved. And perhaps, step by step, you welcome a bit more uncertainty, you think a bit more differently, and you trust that you can still reel it all in towards the end of the process. I think that would be just wonderful.
