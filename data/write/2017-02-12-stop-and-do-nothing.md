> “Try to do nothing… It’s hard, but you can learn a new way of being. You think that when you’re not doing anything, you’re wasting your time. That’s not true. Your time is, first of all, for you to be: to be alive, to be peace, to be joy, and to be loving. The world needs joyous and loving people who are capable of just being without doing… Don’t just do something, sit there.”

– Thich Nhat Hanh in Happiness

*It’s okay. You don’t need to be doing something all the time.* We’ve become more overworked and focused on productivity than ever before, constantly operating off our endless to-do lists and calendar schedules. We cram our days with distractions, whether they be productive or mindless.

I suspect that this constant distraction is often more comforting to us than to stop and do nothing. There’s this positive reinforcement we get whether we’re working hard and being productive or engaged in a stream of mindless entertainment. When all that noise disappears, the silence can feel uneasy.

It’s uncomfortable to stop and find the space where we’re alone with ourselves without the distraction of doing something — to let go, yield control of our attention, daydream, let our minds wander as they please, and observe. It’s only within that space that we can look at ourselves with clarity.

And I wonder… when we’re devoid of the satisfaction of doing something, devoid of the pleasant company of others, devoid of others’ judgements and opinions — **when we stop, do nothing and be with ourselves, alone, without judgement or purpose, with full honesty and openness** — *what is it that we’ll find? Will we find peace? Are we happy?*
