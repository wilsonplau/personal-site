> “People usually consider walking on water or in thin air a miracle. But I think the real miracle is not to walk either on water or in thin air, but to walk on earth. Every day we are engaged in a miracle which we don’t even recognize: a blue sky, white clouds, green leaves, the black, curious eyes of a child — our own two eyes. All is a miracle.

– Thich Nhat Hanh in The Miracle of Mindfulness

![All Yourself to be Impressed](./img/march-19-fb.jpg)

There’s a point in our lives when we’re not so easily impressed anymore. Everything becomes a bit banal. Perhaps it’s the glut of exciting television or dramatic headlines that conditions us to always look for the extraordinary and the scandalous. The ordinary and the simple fail to impress us.

We should learn from those easily excitable children. When we experience the world with a beginner’s mind like they do, we can always find things to be impressed with. Remember that we can always access this perspective — just imagine each day as if we were travelling through an exotic country. Be curious. Find what’s different, new, and beautiful.

We also have to allow ourselves to be vulnerable. We often have an adulthood-induced restraint that makes us feel like it’s important to be cool, serious and act ‘grown up.’ Let go of that. Let yourself revel in the most common, silliest, simplest little things. Let yourself laugh and smile like a madman and experience your most innocent joys.

Try it — even if it makes you feel silly, crazy, or like you’re being judged. Allow yourself to be impressed by how extraordinarily beautiful the day is. Allow yourself to be excited about that moment when you can see your loved ones after a long day. Allow yourself to appreciate the tiny little moments between human beings as miracles.
